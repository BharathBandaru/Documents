Why kubernetes when we can create containers using docker?
The benefits of kubernetes is that 
* Autoscaling
* Scheduling
* Self healing capabilities
* monitor all pods
* running pods on multiple nodes

Orchestration is basiclly running,managing,scaling,monitoring all the pods
we can have a image policy webhook which checks the images we are pulling to create pod is from valid resource.
