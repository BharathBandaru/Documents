Ansible is a Configuration Management tool which is written in python.We instruct ansible by writing yaml files.
Ansible runs on push mechanism and it is agentless.
Ansible is Idempotent but not shell script [100 times you run it runs same]
Only when we do ssh we can know the node is active or not or we can attach the node to nagios to see whether it is available or not.

Chef and puppet are also Configuration management tools which are of push mechanism.
In push mechanism we need agent running in node which checks the server(master) for instructions.

Ansible,chef,puppet Server(master) should be linux and node should be any.
Ansible gives suitable environment to our applications to work.
we can do Change management,provisioning,automation,orchestration using ansible.
